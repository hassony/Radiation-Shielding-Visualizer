# Radiation-Shielding-Visualizer
An interactive, Flask-based toolkit for visualizing how X-rays, gamma rays, protons, and electrons interact with matter. Designed for medical physics education, it simulates attenuation, stopping power, Bragg peaks, and shielding using verified NIST/ICRU data with live plots, reports, and exports.
